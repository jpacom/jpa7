========

The website of [Jahan Pardazesh Alborz Inc](http://jpa7.com/).

This is the whole source code of the JPA website and this can be used as a sample code to determine the way we work on our projects. All the websites we work on are in the same quality, maybe more or less equipped due to the special usage of them.

Everybody may use this source code for qualifying our code or for educational purpose, but to make use of the code in your own website (our your customer's), contact us first.

To run this code, for each language, there should be a subdomain pointing to the 'public_html', the main domain and www subdomain should point to 'public_html' as well. Also, a subomain called 'images' should be set to point to the image folder.
